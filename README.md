# RefStore [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jipe/refstore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jip)
A web application for harvesting, processing and indexing publication references.

## Requirements
- Java 8, Tomcat 8, PostgreSQL 9, Docker 1.9, Docker Compose 1.7, Maven 3

## Running RefStore
RefStore can be run both by deploying to an existing Tomcat and by starting up a number Docker containers.

### Deploying to an existing Tomcat

### Using Docker
The Docker setup is self-contained, so other than Docker and Docker Compose, you don't need to install anything on you local machine. All the services RefStore depends on are started as part of the Docker setup.
